# Plugins

## Fugitive

Is a plugin which allows to use any git command as it's a command for vim.

For example just call ```:G``` or ```:Git``` and it works just like command tools.

So 

```
:G commit -m "initial"
```

is equivalent of: 

```
git commit -m "initial"
```

### Keymap

There is only one and it's, which is actually a hot-key for the :Git command. 

```
Space + gs
```

## Harpoon 

Harpoon allows simple and fast navigation between files.

It provides a system where you can mark files using shortcuts and then quickly jump between them.
As you work on multiple files, you can mark them for easy access, eliminating the need to search for them later.
